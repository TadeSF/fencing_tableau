# Introduction
This Project is a Python-based Web-Application used to manage and host (rather informal) fencing competitions in accordance with FIE Guidlines. It creates a preliminary round and an elimination round with finals for a given number of competitors. The project is still in an early stage and not ready for testing.

During testing, the Web-App will be hosted locally by a Laptop within a local Network that also runs all the Python calculations in the Background. The server is hosted via the Flask Python library.
We are planning on bringing this as a server-hosted webservice to you, but since this is non-profit project we do in our freetime, we don't have the ressources to rent servers yet.

# Features
These are the features we are planning to implement:
### For a Tournament Manager
- Full overview over tournament proceedings, including matches and standings updated in realtime
- Full control over tournament preceedings
- Fully customizable tournaments, including multiple pleniminary rounds, direct elimination, placement matches and repechage

### For a Referee
- Ability to see an access upcoming matches on the given piste
- Starting matches and reporting scores in real time

### For a Fencer
- Participants Hub: Each fencer gets a unique access to his/her own hub
- Overview over upcoming matches, past matches and possibly also statistics about compeditors.
- Overview over current Standings in current round in real time

# Details
Except from the Source-Code and the Documentation which you can soon find here (link coming soon), we are building a Wiki-Page with information on the Mechanics of the differen Tournament styles. Please have a look there.
