# Introduction
Fencing Tableau is a Python-based application used to manage fencing competitions. It creates a preliminary round and an elimination round with finals for a given number of competitors. The project is still in an early stage; I am currently creating a pilot application as proof of concept.

# Goal
The goal is to host a web server to display a Tableau visualization, with all calculations happening in Python in the background. This web server can be hosted by a Raspberry Pi or similar device (I will likely use a Flask server).
