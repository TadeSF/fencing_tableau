Userguide
=========
This is a userguide for the program. It is not a tutorial, but it will help you to understand the program and how to use it to its full potential.

The Tournament Master
---------------------
The Tournament Master is the creator and manager of the tournament. He has the highest clearence and can do (almost) anything. It is advised that he uses a desktop computer or laptop to use the program. The functionality includes the possibilities to display information in a seperate Window (e.g. for a beamer or big screen).

The Tournament Master can:
- Create a new tournament
- Manage all stages of the tournament
- Assign Pistes to matches
- Ban a fencer from the tournament
- Change the status of a match
- Input Scores
- Manage all settings
- Change Fencer Information

Creating a new tournament
*************************
When creating a new tournament, the Tournament Master has to fill in/provide the following information/files:

- Tournament Name
    The name of the tournament. This name will be publicly displayed in the list of all tournaments.
- Tournament Location (optional)
    The location of the tournament. This information will not be public but can be accessed with the right tournament ID.
- Startlist (in .csv format)
    The Startlist must have a certain format. We provide a template_, a sample-file_ and even a dedicated Startlist-Builder_. The Startlist-Builder is a program that helps you to create a startlist. It is not mandatory to use it, but it is highly recommended.
    Please refer to the coresponding section `The Startlist`_ below for more information.
- Number of available pistes
    Must be a fixed number and cannot be changed after the tournament is created.
- Number of preliminary rounds
    Select the number of preliminary rounds that will be played. In each preliminary round, the groups are reassigned according to the standings (or in the first round the Startlist). The number of preliminary rounds cannot be changed after the tournament is created. Defaults to 1. If you want to skip the preliminary rounds and start directly with the elimination round, set the field to None.
- Number of preliminary groups
    Select the number of preliminary groups. The number of preliminary groups cannot be changed after the tournament is created. Defaults to "Auto", which means that the number of groups is calculated automatically according to FIE Guidlines and the total number of fencers.
- First elimination round
    Select the first elimination round. The number of elimination rounds cannot be changed after the tournament is created. Defaults to "Auto", which means that the first elimination round is the next bigger power of 2 after the number of fencers (to make elimination work, wildcards are assigned to the first fencers in the first elimination round). If you want to cap the number of elimination rounds (e.g. you want only the top 32 fencers to advance), set the field to the desired number.
- Elimination mode
    This Web-Application offers three different tournament modes.
    - Direct Elimination ("KO") (default)
    - Repechage (not yet implemented)
    - Direct Elimination with Placement Matches
- Master Password
    The Master Password is used to protect the tournament from unauthorized access. When creating a tournament or logging in as master, a cookie is set in the browser of the user and his/her status is saved.
