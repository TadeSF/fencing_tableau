Welcome to fencing_tableau's documentation!
===========================================

This Project is a Python-based Web-Application used to manage and host (rather informal) fencing competitions in accordance with FIE Guidlines. It creates a preliminary round and an elimination round with finals for a given number of competitors.
The project is still in an early stage and not ready for testing.

During testing, the Web-App will be hosted locally by a Laptop within a local Network that also runs all the Python calculations in the Background. The server is hosted via the Flask Python library. We are planning on bringing this as a server-hosted webservice to you, but since this is non-profit project we do in our freetime, we don't have the ressources to rent servers yet.
